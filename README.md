# Stock-Market-Analysis
The MATLAB code analyses stock prices of a company and predicts the closing price. The algorithms implemented for predicting closing price are: (a)Kalman Filter   (b)Kalman Multiple Linear Regression  The algorithms implemented for analysing the trends in a stock (c) Bollinger bands (d). Chaikin Oscillator Output - 1. Graphs showing the predicted and actual values of  closing price of stock anlong with bollinger bands 2. The chaikin oscillator graph  3. %accuracy of prediction of Kalman and MLR filter ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The stock_analysis.zip file contains the following -  1.
